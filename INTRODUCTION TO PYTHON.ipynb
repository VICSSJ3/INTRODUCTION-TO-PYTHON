        "What is python?\n",
        "python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programing language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasized readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance, Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and core reuse. The python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "often, programmers fall in love with python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stick trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global varibales, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit- test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective."

        "Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at centrum Wiskunde & informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacaion\" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, activate Python core developers elected a 5-member \"steering council\" to lead the project. As of 2021, the current members of this council are Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Carol Willing, Thomas Wouters, and Pablo Galindo Salgado.\n",

        "Python 2.0 was released on 16 october 2020, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python 3.0 Was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code Python 3."
